<br>
<strong>Brokit</strong> is a tool for brokerages to keep track of and manage their clients and the apartments that they're trying to move.

Some features:
<br>-Brokit tracks landlords, clients, apartments, and apartments a specific client is interested in so that the broker has the full picture.
<br>-When a New York address is entered, Brokit looks up the neighborhood. That neighborhood is then a searchable field.
<br>-Brokit has search capability with multiple fields so that the broker can enter 0 parameters or several. Results show whether an apartment is available or about to be applied to.
<br>-Brokit is online, but the site is secure. Access can  only be granted to a Brokit site if an admin sends a user an invite. Clicking on the invite logs the user in and prompts them to enter their own password.
